### These days, you can personalize everything. There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. But, for business, this is actually a great thing. It creates a lot of space for healthy competition and opportunities for companies to get creative about how they acquire and retain customers.
One of the fundamental steps towards better personalization is customer segmentation. This is where personalization starts, and proper segmentation will help you make decisions regarding new features, new products, pricing, marketing strategies, even things like in-app recommendations.

But, doing segmentation manually can be exhausting. Why not employ machine learning to do it for us? In this project we see how to do just that.

### What is customer segmentation?
Customer segmentation simply means grouping your customers according to various characteristics (for example grouping customers by age).

It’s a way for organizations to understand their customers. Knowing the differences between customer groups, it’s easier to make strategic decisions regarding product growth and marketing.

The opportunities to segment are endless and depend mainly on how much customer data you have at your use. Starting from the basic criteria, like gender, hobby, or age, it goes all the way to things like “time spent of website X” or “time since user opened our app”.

There are different methodologies for customer segmentation, and they depend on four types of parameters:

- geographic,

- demographic,

- behavioral,

- psychological.

Geographic customer segmentation is very simple, it’s all about the user’s location. This can be implemented in various ways. You can group by country, state, city, or zip code.

Demographic segmentation is related to the structure, size, and movements of customers over space and time. Many companies use gender differences to create and market products. Parental status is another important feature. You can obtain data like this from customer surveys.

Behavioral customer segmentation is based on past observed behaviors of customers that can be used to predict future actions. For example, brands that customers purchase, or moments when they buy the most. The behavioral aspect of customer segmentation not only tries to understand reasons for purchase but also how those reasons change throughout the year.

Psychological segmentation of customers generally deals with things like personality traits, attitudes, or beliefs. This data is obtained using customer surveys, and it can be used to gauge customer sentiment.

### Advantages of customer segmentation
Implementing customer segmentation leads to plenty of new business opportunities. You can do a lot of optimization in:

- budgeting,

- product design,

- promotion,

- marketing,

- customer satisfaction. 

Let’s discuss these benefits in more depth.
Budgeting Nobody likes to invest in campaigns that don’t generate any new customers. Most companies don’t have huge marketing budgets, so that money has to be spent right. Segmentation enables you to target customers with the highest potential value first, so you get the most out of your marketing budget.

Product design Customer segmentation helps you understand what your users need. You can identify the most active users/customers, and optimize your application/offer towards their needs.

Promotion Properly implemented customer segmentation helps you plan special offers and deals. Frequent deals have become a staple of e-commerce and commercial software in the past few years. If you reach a customer with just the right offer, at the right time, there’s a huge chance they’re going to buy. Customer segmentation will help you tailor your special offers perfectly.

Marketing The marketing strategy can be directly improved with segmentation because you can plan personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments, using the channels that they use the most.

Customer satisfaction By studying different customer groups, you learn what they value the most about your company. This information will help you create personalized products and services that perfectly fit your customers’ preferences.

### Machine Learning for customer segmentation

Machine learning methodologies are a great tool for analyzing customer data and finding insights and patterns. Artificially intelligent models are powerful tools for decision-makers. They can precisely identify customer segments, which is much harder to do manually or with conventional analytical methods.

There are many machine learning algorithms, each suitable for a specific type of problem. One very common machine learning algorithm that’s suitable for customer segmentation problems is the k-means clustering algorithm. There are other clustering algorithms as well such as DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering, and BIRCH, etc.

### Why would you implement machine learning for customer segmentation?

More time Manual customer segmentation is time-consuming. It takes months, even years to analyze piles of data and find patterns manually. Also if done heuristically, it may not have the accuracy to be useful as expected.

Customer segmentation used to be done manually and wasn’t very precise. You'd manually create and populate various data tables before analyzing the data like a detective with a magnifying glass. Now, it’s much better (and relatively easy thanks to rapid progress in ML) to just use machine learning, which can free up your time to focus on more demanding problems that require creativity to solve.

Ease of retraining Customer segmentation is not a “develop once and use forever” type of project. Data is ever-changing, trends oscillate, and everything keeps changing after your model is deployed. Usually, more labeled data becomes available after development, and it’s a great resource for improving the overall performance of your model.

There are many ways to update customer segmentation models, but here are the two main approaches:

Use the old model as the starting point and retrain it. Keep the existing model and combine its output with that of a new model. Better scaling Machine learning models deployed in production support scalability, thanks to cloud infrastructure. These models are quite flexible for future changes and feedback. For example, consider a company that has 10,000 customers today, and has implemented a customer segmentation model. After a year, if the company has 1 million customers, then ideally we don’t need to create a separate project to handle this increased data. Machine learning models have the inherent capability to handle more data and scale production.

Higher accuracy The value of an optimal number of clusters for given customer data is easy to find using machine learning methods like the elbow method. Not only the optimal number of clusters but also the performance of the model is far better when we use machine learning.
